    review: `Saad's technical talents are very special - partIcularly his uncanny ability to source support talent around him
      and get high production-level results on the fly w/ either an over-articulated Project plan or within a Project plan
      with limited advisory on scope or direction.
      What made me blush a bit was trying to figure how this guy operates with the grace and polish that someone
      20 years his senior would have (like me). RELIABLE. Calm under duress. Everyone in his space has to own it,
      few do it at the drop of a hat, with PRIMO results every damned time.
      I wish I had that toolbox at his age.
      I can't speak to his web work on the record as a web dev expert as my focus is IT backbone & managing our
      User-facing ops. But I thought it was awesome - I asked my wife who is a high-end web presence for a big
      Chicago digital marketing agency and we agreed his work was gorgeous and was smooth, the moving parts in
      the url were always sewn in perfectly.
      Saad also regularly worked out of the dev scope (thanks man!!) and was a treasured tech resource I will sorely
      miss, he was our top technical expert for a very long time.
      And he's a cool guy to work with - a good human. It will be fun to see where he's at in 5 years, I think his work
      here was slowing down a very very promising career, no offense to us - he just happens to have a very high
      ceiling, I see that. Really talented, nice dude! Miss him!`,

    review:
      "I had the opportunity to work with Saad on several products, and I was consistently impressed with his ability to reach all deadlines while maintaining the highest quality of work. As our tech team lead, Saad was responsible for managing a diverse team of backend and frontend developers, product managers, and software architects and produced top-quality results, even with frequent changes in project requirements. He was able to keep everyone focused and motivated, ensuring that we always delivered our best work on time. Saad was also a great collaborator, always willing to listen to feedback and incorporate it into his work. I would highly recommend Saad to anyone looking for a talented and dedicated software engineer who excels at team leadership and collaboration.",

    review:
      "Saad is a rare talent.  He has incredible maturity for his youth and is able to handle a major workload on relatively little instruction. I highly recommend any company in need of a software engineer, full stack developer, app developer to give Saad a look.  He's able to simultaneously manage a team and work deeply on the problems he has been given. I changed programming languages on him a couple of times, and he was able to get the implementations hooked into the new languages quickly and seemlessly.In addition to his incredible programming skill and team management skills, he's a great guy to work with.  Very friendly, responsive, and able to stand his ground against absurd requests.",

    review:
      "Farhan has been working with me as a full-stack software developer since July 2020. He is a hard worker that can write thousands of lines of code with a smile on his face. He has helped me with various cross-platform apps, websites and e-commerce projects for USA based clients. I am very impressed by Farhan's communication skills which came in handy when gathering requirements or presenting deliverables to clients who weren't particularly tech savvy. Farhan takes his programming seriously and regularly takes online classes to experiment with new programming trends. I can throw any new technology framework at him and he'll build me a prototype over-night ... it is a magical experience. He is an easy going fellow who goes out of his way to sync with the team, and resolve any problems we may have. He is constantly looking for guidance and training, and posses all the right signs to become a young leader.",
